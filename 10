Package: Airqual
Title: Air Quality Analysis and Prediction
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: "Dylan Pearl <dpearl@usf.edu> [aut, cre]"
The Airqual package is designed to help users analyze air 
    quality data and predict levels of harmful pollutants, such as ozone. 
    It provides a collection of easy-to-use functions that allow users 
    to prepare and clean their data, making it ready for analysis. The 
    package also includes several statistical and machine learning methods 
    for building predictive models. Users can choose the best model for 
    their specific needs and evaluate its performance to ensure accurate 
    predictions.  In addition to modeling, the package offers tools for visualizing 
    air quality data, helping users understand trends and patterns over 
    time. This package is ideal for researchers, students, and anyone 
    interested in exploring the impact of air pollution on health and 
    the environment. Whether you are looking to conduct detailed studies 
    or simply want to learn more about air quality, the Friedman package  
    provides the resources you need to get started.

For my final project, I plan to create an R package called VisuaR to make it easier for people to create great-looking data visualizations. 
This package will provide simple themes for ggplot2, special types of plots like radar charts and heatmaps, and tools to help prepare data for visualizing. 
It will also allow users to export their plots in different formats with easy settings. VisuaR is aimed at data analysts, researchers, and teachers, helping 
everyone make clear and attractive visuals from their data. I will share the package on GitHub so others can use it and help improve it.
